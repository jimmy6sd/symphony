### Analysis of CS01:
- ✅ Subscriptions **exceeded** budget (104%)
- 🔴 Single tickets **well behind** budget (78% achieved, but only 48% of total budget)
- 🔴 **Behind pacing**: Only 227 singles vs 582 projected
- 🟡 Occupancy projected at 76.6% (below 85% target)
- ✅ Good customer retention (96.6% returning)
- 🔴 Low new customer acquisition (only 13 new households)

## Data Quality Assessment

### ✅ High Quality Data
- Budget targets complete and accurate
- Projection models present for most performances
- Audience intelligence comprehensive
- Sales velocity calculations working

### ⚠️ Needs Attention
- Series code extraction not perfect (some performances have `null`)
  - **Fix**: Improve regex to handle "CS01" vs "CS1" formats
- Individual pacing models not fully extracted yet
  - **Next**: Deep dive into pacing sheet structure
- Date range matching between Board and Weekly sheets incomplete

### 🔧 Improvements for Phase 2

1. **Better Series Code Matching**
   - Handle "CS01" and "CS1" variations
   - Extract from both performance name and Board sheet

2. **Pacing Model Deep Extraction**
   - Extract week-by-week expected sales percentages
   - Build expected pacing curves for comparison

3. **Date Normalization**
   - Standardize date formats between sheets
   - Handle date ranges (Oct 10-12) vs individual dates

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

Now that we have Excel data extracted, Phase 2 will:

1. **Query PDF webhook data** from database
2. **Build historical timeline** per performance
3. **Match performances** between Excel and PDF data
4. **Calculate week-over-week progression** from PDFs

This will give us:
- Excel: Budget targets, projections, audience data (strategic)
- PDF: Real-time sales history, week-by-week progression (tactical)
- Combined: Complete picture of performance sales trajectory

## Usage

### Extract Excel Data

```bash
# Use default Excel file in root
npm run extract-excel

# Or specify custom path
node scripts/extract-excel-data.js "path/to/excel-file.xlsx"
```

### Inspect Extracted Data

```bash
node inspect-excel-data.js
```

### Access in Code

```javascript
const excelData = require('./data/excel-extracted.json');

// Get all performances
const performances = excelData.performances;

// Find specific performance
const cs1 = performances.find(p => p.performanceName.includes('Appalachian'));

// Filter by type
const classical = performances.filter(p => p.performanceType === 'Classical');

// Get budget summary
const totalBudget = performances.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.budget.total, 0);
```
