# Current Situation - Complete Analysis

## Where Is Your Data Right Now?

### 1. **BigQuery Database** (Cloud - Production)
**Location**: Google Cloud BigQuery
**Access**: Via `/.netlify/functions/bigquery-data` API

**What's there:**
- 118 total performances in `performances` table
- 60 performances **with sales data** (`has_sales_data = true`)
- 58 performances **without sales data** (placeholders)

**Source**: These 60 came from your **initial data load** on Oct 1, 2025
- Not from PDFs processed through webhook
- Loaded directly into BigQuery somehow
- `last_pdf_import_date` is `null` for all records

**Key Question**: How did this data get into BigQuery?
- The webhook test was successful but didn't persist data
- There must have been a bulk import or migration script
- Need to verify: Is this fresh PDF data or old data?

### 2. **Local Files**
**PDF Files** (root directory):
- `FY26 Performance Sales Summary_1124675.pdf`
- `FY26 Performance Sales Summary_1126300.pdf`

**Excel File** (root directory):
- `KCS 25-26 Weekly Sales Report - Sep 17.xlsx` (dated Sep 17, 2025)

**Generated Data Files** (data/ directory):
- `excel-extracted.json` - 102 records from Excel
- `bigquery-extracted.json` - 60 records from BigQuery
- `unified-dashboard-data.json` - Old merge (78% match rate)
- `dashboard-data.json` - New merge with BigQuery priority (5% match rate)

## The Real Question: What's the Source of Truth?

### Option A: BigQuery IS Fresh (Best Case)
**If BigQuery already has fresh PDF data:**
- ‚úÖ Use BigQuery directly
- ‚úÖ Excel supplements with projections
- ‚úÖ No shortcuts needed
- **Just need to**: Update dashboard to use BigQuery API

### Option B: BigQuery is Stale (Needs Fresh PDFs)
**If BigQuery has old data:**
- üìÑ Process the 2 PDF files through webhook ‚Üí BigQuery
- üìä Then use BigQuery as source of truth
- üìà Excel supplements with projections
- **Need to**: Run PDFs through webhook first

### Option C: Fresh Data is Only in Excel
**If Excel has fresher data than BigQuery:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem: We said PDF is source of truth, but BigQuery might be old
- üîÑ Need to: Get fresh PDFs processed first
- **Then**: Follow Option B

## Let Me Investigate Your Current Setup

### Questions to Answer:

1. **When was the BigQuery data last updated?**
   - All records show: `updated_at: 2025-10-01T15:47:57.472Z`
   - That's October 1, 2025 (2 days ago from your "today" date of Oct 2)
   - Is this fresh or stale?

2. **Have PDFs been processed through the webhook?**
   - Webhook exists and tests passed
   - But `last_pdf_import_date` is null for all records
   - This suggests: No, PDFs haven't been processed yet

3. **What's in those 2 PDF files?**
   - Need to extract and see what dates they cover
   - Compare to BigQuery data
   - Determine if they're newer or same snapshot

4. **What's the "right" workflow?**
   - Should PDFs go through webhook ‚Üí BigQuery?
   - Or should we load PDFs directly?
   - Or is BigQuery already correct?
